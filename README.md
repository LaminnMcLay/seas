# SEAS ontologies

This project contains the sources of the [ITEA 2 SEAS](http://the-smart-energy.com) Knowledge Model, and the sources of the website that exposes this Knowledge Model. This website is conform with the specifications described in SEAS deliverable 2.2. Among other: 

 1. SEAS Ontologies are properly modularized and versioned;
 1. There is only one namespace for ontologies and every SEAS resource. this namespace is very simple: https://w3id.org/seas/ ;
 1. ALL of the important good practices promoted by the W3C consortium are met. 

The current SEAS ontologies and the resources are already accessible at their URIs. Try for instance the following URIs in your browser or in [Protégé](http://protege.stanford.edu/):

 - https://w3id.org/seas/ (the main ontology)
 - https://w3id.org/seas/BuildingOntology  (a module ontology)
 - https://w3id.org/seas/BuildingOntology/0.9  (a module ontology in a specific version)
 - https://w3id.org/seas/EndNode   (a resource defined by the ArchitectureOntology module)

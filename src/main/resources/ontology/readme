This folder contains the SEAS ontology documents. 

Every ontology document must be a Turtle document, and be named as follows:

NAME-MAJOR.MINOR.ttl

where:
 - NAME matches ^[a-z]*$
 - MAJOR matches ^[0-9]+$
 - MINOR matches ^[0-9]+$

see http://semver.org/ for semantic versioning specification

The void ontologyName is used for the ontology document that imports all of the ontologies.

Every ontology must contain the following triples:

<http://w3id.org/seas/NAME> a owl:Ontology ;
  owl:versionIRI <http://w3id.org/seas/NAME/MAJOR.MINOR> ;
  owl:versionInfo "vMAJOR.MINOR" .

For every other resource in the ontology, it must be specified that it is defined by the ontology.

<http://w3id.org/seas/SOME_RESOURCE> rdfs:definedBy <http://w3id.org/seas/NAME> .

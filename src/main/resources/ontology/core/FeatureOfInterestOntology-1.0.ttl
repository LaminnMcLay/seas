  dc:description """This ontology defines feature of interest and their properties, as an extension of the core classes of the SSN ontology (https://www.w3.org/ns/ssn/). It adds two more core classes: feature of interest definition, and property keys.

  A feature of interest is an abstraction of a real world phenomena (thing, person, event, etc). 

  A property is a qualifiable, quantifiable, observable or operable Quality of a feature of interest.

  Property keys are functional properties that are sub properties of ssn:hasProperty. They link a feature of interest to one of its qualities, that can then further be quantified.

  Feature of interest definitions define the set of properties that feature of interest complying with this definition may have."""@en ;

  This concept is equivalent to ssn:FeatureOfInterest, which in the first version of the SSN ontology is defined as a subclass of the union of dul:Event and dul:Object. A dul:Event is any physical, social, or mental process, event, or state. A dul:Object is any physical, social, or mental object, or a substance.

That is, not a quality of an abstract entity as is also allowed by DUL's Quality, but rather an aspect of an entity that is intrinsic to and cannot exist without the entity and is observable by a sensor, or operable by an actuator. This concept is equivalent to ssn:Property, which in the first version of the SSN ontology is a subclass of dul:Quality. dul:Quality is any aspect of an Entity (but not a part of it), which cannot exist without that Entity. The Semantic Actuator Network Ontology (SAN) proposes that ssn:Property be a subClass of qudt:QuantityKind. Yet a property may be not measureable and numerically quantifiable. Indeed, it may also be a boolean, or any other kind of quality value (e.g., "UNOPERATED").

  seas:Property extends qudt:Quantity because the evaluated property may not be a Quantity, but have several qualifiable aspects.
  For example, the property may be an alternating current signal. Then several aspects of this signal may be qualified. Examples of such aspects include:
   - The average peak value;
   - the minimal operating value of the frequency;
   - the number of occurences of unusual values."""@en ;

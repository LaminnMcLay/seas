# SEAS ontologies

This site exposes the SEAS ontologies. 

The main ontology is available at this URL, it glues together all the other ontologies.

  https://w3id.org/seas/

Then the core ontologies are:

- The Feature of Interest ontology -  https://w3id.org/seas/FeatureOfInterestOntology
- The Evaluation ontology -  https://w3id.org/seas/EvaluationOntology
- The Graph ontology -  https://w3id.org/seas/GraphOntology
- The Process ontology -  https://w3id.org/seas/ProcessOntology
- The System ontology -  https://w3id.org/seas/SystemOntology
